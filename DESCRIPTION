Description: Implements parsimonious hidden Markov models for four-way data via expectation-
    conditional maximization algorithm, as described in Tomarchio et al. (2020) <arXiv:2107.04330>.
    The matrix-variate normal distribution is used as emission distribution. For each hidden
    state, parsimony is reached via the eigen-decomposition of the covariance matrices of the
    emission distribution. This produces a family of 98 parsimonious hidden Markov models.
